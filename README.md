# Chatting DApp using Solidity and ReactJS with the Polygon Blockchain

I built a Decentralized chatting application on Polygon test-network. The DApp will allow users to connect with other people and chat with them. I have deployed smart contract using Remix on Polygon chain.

Install it and run:

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```
